# 🎮 MyGameList

A website inspired by [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net), where users can create and share lists of games they've played. The platform collects user ratings together to provide global scores for each game. Users will also be able to make reviews for games in their lists.

## 2. Set up MariaDB database.
1. Set up the database and tables
- You can do this in whichever way you prefer i hosted it on from Ubuntu on a virtual machine for my project.
- The SQL used for the database and tables are in the project folder as "database.sql"

2. Listen to all networks 
⚠️This may be different on different Linux distros.⚠️
- Open your terminal and write: sudo nano /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf
- In here change the bind-address to 0.0.0.0
- It should look like this
```bash
bind-address = 0.0.0.0
```

3. Open ports
- Open port 8080, this is the port waitress uses to access the database.
Note: If you are planning on running the static on apache you might wanna enable port 80 as well.
```bash
sudo ufw allow 8080
```

4. Change ip on python file
- In the app1.py file change the host ip to mach the one of your database.
